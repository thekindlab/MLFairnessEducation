# Fairness in NLP Teaching Materials

These materials are designed to teach students about the topic of fairness in machine learning. The materials are described in more detail in the [SIGCSE paper: 
Towards Machine Learning Fairness Education in a Natural Language Processing Course](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3545945.3569802), with a discussion on what went well and what can be improved in the future.
